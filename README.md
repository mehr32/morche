## Simple Python script for generating visual data along with its related text for training an OCR model. 

You can write modules for creating various images or add different backgrounds and colors.

### How to use:

First, install the prerequisites:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*To use the curved text module, you need to have ImageMagick installed on your system (It slows down the image generation process. If not, comment it out).*

Put your raw text in the text.txt file and run morche.py! Wait for the data to be generated. 

*A few Persian fonts are included by default. If needed, change them (not tested on English or other languages but shouldn't be a problem).*
